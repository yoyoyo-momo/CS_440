        This function calculates softmax(Q K^T / sqrt(d_k))V for the attention heads; further, a key_padding_mask is given so that padded regions are not attended, and an attention_mask is provided so that we can disallow attention for some part of the sequence
        Input:
        query (torch.Tensor) - Query; torch tensor of size B x num_heads x T_q x d_k, where B is the batch size, T_q is the number of time steps of the query (aka the target sequence), num_head is the number of attention heads, and d_k is the feature dimension;

        key (torch.Tensor) - Key; torch tensor of size B x num_head x T_k x d_k, where in addition, T_k is the number of time steps of the key (aka the source sequence);

        value (torch.Tensor) - Value; torch tensor of size B x num_head x T_v x d_k; where in addition, T_v is the number of time steps of the value (aka the source sequence);, and we assume d_v = d_k
        Note: We assume T_k = T_v as the key and value come from the same source in the Transformer implementation, in both the encoder and the decoder.

        key_padding_mask (None/torch.Tensor) - If it is not None, then it is a torch.IntTensor/torch.LongTensor of size B x T_k, where for each key_padding_mask[b] for the b-th source in the batch, the non-zero positions will be ignored as they represent the padded region during batchify operation in the dataloader (i.e., disallowed for attention) while the zero positions will be allowed for attention as they are within the length of the original sequence

        attention_mask (None/torch.Tensor) - If it is not None, then it is a torch.IntTensor/torch.LongTensor of size 1 x T_q x T_k or B x T_q x T_k, where again, T_q is the length of the target sequence, and T_k is the length of the source sequence. An example of the attention_mask is used for decoder self-attention to enforce auto-regressive property during parallel training; suppose the maximum length of a batch is 5, then the attention_mask for any input in the batch will look like this for each input of the batch.
