    "Now, consider the more general and harder problem of finding the shortest path through a maze while hitting multiple waypoints. As suggested in Part 1, your state representation, goal test, and transition model should already be adapted to deal with this scenario. The next challenge is to solve different mazes using A* search with an appropriate admissible heuristic that takes into account the multiple waypoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, one popular approach that has been taken is what we refer to as the \"greedy\" method, that is to greedily choose the closest waypoint to the current position, run A* on it, and repeat until all waypoints have been reached. Why is this suboptimal? Think about what happens if the nearest waypoint is in the center of a long line of waypoints. Clearly, this strategy will not always choose the best path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, there is a beautiful heuristic that will not only find the optimal path through all the waypoints, but is admissable as well. It is based on a data structure you hopefully have seen before: the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). Instead of computing the distances to each waypoint from the current position, it would be more helpful to obtain an estimate of the cost of reaching the rest of the unreached waypoints once we have reached one. Obtaining this estimate can be done with an MST: by constructing a graph where the vertices are the waypoints and each edge connecting w_i to w_j has weight chebyshev_distance(w_i, w_j) for all pairs of vertices (w_i, w_j), the MST represents the approximate lowest cost path that connects all the waypoints. Since it strictly underestimates the cost of going through all the waypoints, this is an admissable heuristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, suppose you are in the middle of a search. You're at some location (x,y) with a set of S waypoints still to reach. Your heuristic function h should be the sum of the distance from (x,y) to the nearest waypoint, plus the MST length for the waypoints in S.\n",
